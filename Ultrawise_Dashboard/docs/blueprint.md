# **App Name**: AquaTrack

## Core Features:

- Sensor Data Ingestion: Real-time data ingestion from ultrasonic sensors deployed in data centers.
- Dashboard Visualization: Display of real-time water level, flow rate, and consumption data, with historical trending.
- Anomaly Detection: AI-powered anomaly detection to identify leaks, evaporation losses, and cooling inefficiencies, alerting system
- Predictive Maintenance: AI tool that recommends predictive maintenance based on sensor data and historical patterns, preventing downtime.
- Carbon Footprint Integration: Integration of water consumption data with IT energy load and carbon emissions data for comprehensive environmental assessment.
- Optimization Recommendations: AI tool that provides recommendations for optimizing cooling cycles and reducing water waste, improving WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness).
- Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports on water consumption, carbon footprint, and optimization insights.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of water and environmental awareness.
- Background color: Very light desaturated teal (#F0FFFF) to create a calm, clean interface.
- Accent color: Muted Yellow (#D4AC0D) for key metrics and alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined look, appropriate for a dashboard.
- Use clear, minimalist icons representing water levels, flow, carbon emissions, and other key metrics.
- Dashboard layout should be clean and intuitive, with key metrics prominently displayed and easy navigation between different data views.
- Subtle animations to visualize real-time data updates and system status changes.
